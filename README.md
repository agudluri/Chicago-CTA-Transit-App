# Chicago-CTA-Transit-App
A JAVA based application for Chicago's rail transit system. Sans a GUI.

**Problem:

Create a program that models the CTA and allows users to interact with the data it
contains. How the system is designed is entirely up to you, but it must meet the following
requirements:

• Add a new station to the CTA system and be able to verify that the data has been
added

• ‘find’ (search) for a specific station; users should be able to verify that the search
was successful or unsuccessful

• Delete a station from the CTA system; user should be able to verify that the data
was deleted

• Generate a route from a starting station to a destination station (this should be
able to handle the possibility of a user needing to transfer from one line to
another)

• Find the nearest station to a location

• Exit the program

The user should be continually prompted to choose between the above options and can
exit the menu with the appropriate choice. The verification of each operation should be visible
by console displays. You may of course add additional menu options.
